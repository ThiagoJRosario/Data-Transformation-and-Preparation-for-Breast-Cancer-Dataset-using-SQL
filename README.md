# Data-Transformation-and-Preparation-for-Breast-Cancer-Dataset-using-SQL

This project focuses on cleaning and transforming a breast cancer dataset, originally obtained from the University Medical Centre, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia. The goal is to apply various data transformation techniques such as categorization, encoding, and binarization to create a refined dataset that can be used in future analyses by data science teams.

Label Encoding: Applied to the variable "menopause", class, irradiat to convert categorical values into numerical labels.
One-Hot Encoding: Performed on the column deg_malig to convert its categorical values into binary columns.
Final Dataset Creation: A new dataset was generated containing all variables after the aforementioned transformations.

This transformed dataset provides a cleaner and more structured data source for future machine learning models and analyses related to breast cancer research.
