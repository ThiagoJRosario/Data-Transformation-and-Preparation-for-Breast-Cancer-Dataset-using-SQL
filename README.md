# Data-Transformation-and-Preparation-for-Breast-Cancer-Dataset-using-SQL

This project focuses on cleaning and transforming a breast cancer dataset, originally obtained from the University Medical Centre, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia. The goal is to apply various data transformation techniques such as categorization, encoding, and binarization to create a refined dataset that can be used in future analyses by data science teams.
This transformed dataset provides a cleaner and more structured data source for future machine learning models and analyses related to breast cancer research.
